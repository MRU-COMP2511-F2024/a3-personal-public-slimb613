                            degree in
                            Computer Information Systems. I chose this degree to build a versatile skill that bridges
                            the gap
                            between technology and business.Feel free to explore my projectsâ€”I hope you enjoy them as
                            much as I
                            enjoyed creating them! If you have any questions, my contact details are just a click away.
