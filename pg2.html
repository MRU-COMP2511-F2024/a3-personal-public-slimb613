      <h2 id="a1">Assignment 1</h2>
      <p>We needed to apply Gestalt principles, use low-fidelity prototyping, and build a
        well-structured design with semantic HTML tags, accessible images, consistent navigation, and CSS styling.

        </div>
      </section>
      <p id="reflect-1">We planned the design and content together, split tasks effectively, and I applied new HTML and
        CSS skills.
        While some design aspects caused confusion, consistent communication helped. For future assignments, I'd focus
        on detailed planning, clear understanding of tasks, and setting internal deadlines.</p>

            <p>It was exciting to see how the browser adjusted as we changed the device size, and it made me reflect on
              how similar features work in apps I use, like WhatsApp.</p>

      <p id="reflect-2">We took a different approach to this assignment compared to Assignment 1, working more
        individually.
        Although our results varied, I learned a lot about how display types like flexbox and grid affect element
        tags differently and how they cascade effectively using semantic structure.</p>
